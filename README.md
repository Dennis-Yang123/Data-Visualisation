# Data-Visualisation 

This was a project for a Data Visualisation module during my third year studying at the University of Essex. It consisted of carrying out a single report containing various visualisations on a dataset which contained crime and policing statistics in Dallas, Texas 2016. You can find more about the dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/center-for-policing-equity/data-science-for-good>. I received a grade of 90% for this module.
